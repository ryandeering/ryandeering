### Hello!

I'm Ryan, a software developer from Dublin, Ireland. I work as a Full Stack Developer at Circit. I graduated with First Class Honours in Computing with Software Development from Technological University Dublin in 2021. I'm a full-stack .NET/TypeScript developer by trade, but I like messing around with my Raspberry Pis, Python, low level languages and a whole other lot of assorted computing things. I've also been a Linux user since 2010 🐧
